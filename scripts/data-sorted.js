We strive to make the best products with the best ingredients to keep you coming back for more. All our products are hand poured and hand made from small batches to keep everything fresh for your benefit. If you have any questions on our products or any feedback, please feel free to send us a convo. \r\n***********************************************\r\n~Argan Oil: Argan oil is often referred to as a miracle product or liquid gold because of its extreme moisturising benefits for both hair and skin. Unlike other oils, Argan extracts don\u2019t just temporarily mask dryness. The kernels contain vitamin E to restore each strand of hair and keep it moisturised long after use. At the same time, Argan oil helps to naturally restore the hair cuticle. This is made possible by the natural presence of antioxidants that directly reverse cellular damage. It Contains unsaturated fats omega 3 and omega 9 which helps prevent split ends by strengthening the protein bonding structures of the hair.\r\n\r\n~Jojoba oil: Is fantastic for beards because of its ability to strengthen and moisturize facial hair. Because it is nontoxic and non-allergenic, Jojoba oil does not leave behind a greasy build up so you can use it on a daily basis. And unlike synthetic products that strip your hair of its natural oils, Jojoba oil actually strengthens and enhances your beard\u2019s natural oils and decreases the chance of breakage. Jojoba oil will help keep your beard soft, healthy and manageable.\r\n\r\n~Avocado Oil: Avocado oil is good for moisturizing dry, brittle, and damaged hair. It has a light weight formula that\u2019s easily absorbed into the hair without clogging your pores. It contains many nutrients such as vitamins A, B, D, E, protein, amino acids, iron, copper, magnesium, and folic acid. All these nutrients are beneficial for nourishment and hair growth. It has natural humectant properties adding and locking in moisture. It\u2019s also great for deep conditioning, strengthening hair, and adding shine. The vitamins, amino acids, and high fat content promote healthy cell growth and are great for maintaining and restoring beard health.\r\nVitamin E: promotes the production of sebum, a natural oil that is produced by our bodies and lubricates and moisturizes hair, making it look thicker and more lush.\r\n\r\nBeard Oil Ingredients: Ingredients: Argan Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance Oil\r\n*Directions: Massage a small amount into hands and then apply to beard.\r\n\r\nMustache Wax Ingredients: Soybean Oil, Sunflower Oil, Beeswax, Hemp Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Vitamin C, Aloe Vera, and Essential Oil\r\n*Directions: Rub a small amount onto fingers and then style. A small amount will go a long way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeardology:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KehoeNaturals?section_id=13701422\r\n\r\nGift Sets:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KehoeNaturals?section_id=11961110\r\n\r\nShop Home:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KehoeNaturals?ref=si_shop\r\n\r\nShop Policies:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KehoeNaturals\/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav",

The products apply easily and the conditioner (oil) does not come out fast, so it does not get wasted. But more importantly of all, my husbands beard has never been softer! He has a very curly and course beard and now it is just as smooth as the hair on the top of his head! We have tried many different products but none have done what this set has. It keeps the skin underneath clean but not dry, it softens the hair, and it smells wonderful. .&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;as an ambassador for the manly man, I have to say this is a fantastic product, within seconds and i am not kidding my beard became softer and took on a beautiful lustre. The perfume of the essential oils blended wonderfully with my bay rum and i really cannot recommend this product more. Oh my girlfriend liked the feel and smell too!!! fantastic.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Never have I had such a luxurious beard, women now swoon at my feet and men grow shameful of their ragged tufts of chin fuzz. I know now what my life could be...what my beard could be. Anyone sitting on the fence about this product should stop sitting there with a sub-par beard and embrace the wild man. &quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I bought it for my boyfriend, he loves it, and I do too!! The scent is perfectly measured, I thought it would be way more powerful, but as I said it is just perfect! It also makes the beard really soft, and thanks to this product, there is no more conflict between my sensitive skin and his beard! &quot;\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nPlease read Wild Rose&#39;s Shop Policies before ordering:\r\nwww.etsy.com\/shop\/WildRoseHerbs\/policy\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nINTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS\r\nAll international orders will ship via USPS First Class Mail with insurance.

    "description": "This kit has it all!\r\n\r\nBeard Balm makes cranky beards happy.\r\nOur growth stimulating oil is beautifully coupled with our extremely fancy beard balm. Our beard balm is easily applicable, and never clumps up. It is weather resistant, as in it won&#39;t melt all over your face and get in your mouth when it&#39;s hot. Although, that would be ok because our magnificent beard balm is also totally natural, utilizing only the highest quality products.\r\n\r\nOur beard oils are a blend of high quality essential oils paired with jojoba oil, castor oil, and grapeseed oil. This layered oil cocktail will leave your beard feeling soft, looking shiny, and even promote healthy new growth. Our oils come in a variety of scents, each custom blended to be subtle, yet masculine.\r\n\r\nThis custom blended mustache wax is not for the faint of heart. Your mustache will stand proud & curled. This no-nonsense wax will tough it out through the day with little need for reapplication, without a flaky mess!\r\n\r\nIn your purchase notes please include the combination of scents you would like, options are as follows:\r\n\r\nBalm:\r\nCastle Black : Lavender, Birch Tar, Vanilla, Sage (Woodsy) \r\nHighlander: : Highlander: : Bergamot,  Eucalyptus, Lemon  ( Fresh & Clean) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeard Oil:\r\nDapper Fellow: Sweet Citrus Sage\r\nModern Gentleman: Cedar Orange\r\nUrban Traveler: Lavender Bergamot\r\nRustic Lad: Rosemary Thyme\r\nWhiskey Pine: Amber Balsam Fir",

You\u2019re good \r\n\r\nlooking, professional, women love you and you know it.  But,\u2026. Sometime that \r\n\r\nbeard gets a little itchy, out of shape and smells like yesterday\u2019s pizza lunch and \r\n\r\nsushi dinner combined.\r\n\r\nJoin our club and never look like a Robertson again. Beardcrafters is your \r\n\r\nessential beard care total package.  Turn that scraggly beard into a great \r\n\r\nsmelling, non itchy, groomed masterpiece that will have everyone saying. \r\n\r\n\u201cwow, what a manly man beard he has\u201d  \r\n\r\nBeardCrafters takes care of making sure you have all the essential beard care \r\n\r\nproducts, even a comb (that is if you can get it through the scraggly beard) and \r\n\r\nwe will automatically send you additional items each month. No matter what \r\n\r\ntype of beard you have, you have to take care of it. This is perfect for the young \r\n\r\nprofessional in you during the day, the hipster at night and the love making \r\n\r\nmachine after that date.\r\n\r\nYour first order come packed in this wonderful wood case, along with a variety \r\n\r\nof different products to include but not be inclusive of:\r\n\r\nBeard Wash: Specially formulated shampoo for those rough stumbles of beard.  \r\n\r\nGet all that old crap out of the beard and now it is fresh and clean.  No more \r\n\r\nsmelling like an old fisherman or worst yet, looking like one.\r\n\r\nBeard Oils: A dapper and dashing bearded guy needs to keep that beard soft so \r\n\r\nthat when the ladies touch it they love it and that it also smell good.  Oohh it\u2019s \r\n\r\nso soft.  There\u2019s really only one time you don\u2019t want to hear that, but it is ok \r\n\r\nwhen talking about your beard.\r\n\r\nBeard Balm:  Just like the oil and you can use one today, and the other the next \r\n\r\nday, you don\u2019t need both at one time, and it is just a matter of what you are \r\n\r\ndoing and how you want to look on that day.  This is used more for styling and if \r\n\r\nyou are going to your barbershop quartet concert than I would use this on that \r\n\r\nday and give your mustache a little twirl.\r\n\r\nNow are you ready to be that Manly Man and have that studly beard that the \r\n\r\nwomen will swoon about.",

    "title": "Personalized Handmade Folding Wood Beard Comb",
    "description": "This is a small handmade beard comb that is crafted with bamboo scales which can be personalized with your favorite initials, nickname, or monogram. The tigerlily marble acrylic comb conveniently flips out to reveal both wide and narrow teeth to properly groom your entire beard and is appropriate for different phases of whisker growth. The smooth wood handle swivels 360 degrees, like a straight razor, to hit hard-to-reach areas and allow use with either hand while ensuring a handsome and healthy beard.\r\n\r\nMade from 5-ply alternating bamboo layers that run perpendicular to each other for strength and durability, this little comb is pretty hardy and appropriate as an everyday carry. I had one on my person while chopping firewood and shooting a Colt 1911 with a Marine Captain and a Buddhist Monk on a working cattle ranch. True story.\r\n\r\nFolds neatly into its handle and rides well in your pocket or dopp kit. Guaranteed to tame the beard on any lumberjack, ship captain, or blacksmith.  \r\n\r\nApproximately 3.6&quot; folded\r\n\r\nHandmade in Texas!\r\n\r\nWe offer FREE engraving.\r\n\r\nPlease FAVORITE our shop to keep up with newly added products.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t see what you&#39;re looking for or have a special request?

We make interesting things for interesting people, just like you.  Here in our shop, we consider the products that we create to be our own personal pet-projects.  These are the things we think are pretty cool and we hope that you will like them too.  Our personalized products are mostly small and unique conversation pieces that will make you the envy of all your friends \u2013 If you\u2019re not already.  In which case, our wares will make a great personalized gift for that person that seems to have everything.\r\n\r\nAt heart, our mini-Fab is rooted its tradition as a classic woodshop.  Most of our items are completely handmade in Texas using traditional woodworking techniques as well as cutting-edge digital fabrication.  We have a shop full of conventional tools as well as laser cutters, CNC routers, and a 3-D printer to help make your project.  Our products are typically made out of wood, leather, cork, acrylic, and aluminum, but that doesn&#39;t stop us from experimenting with other stuff.  We try to locally source materials that are eco-friendly and sustainable, whenever possible, and try to put every last scrap to good use in order to minimize waste.  Some of our natural wood stains are made in our shop using household items such as vinegar, steel wool, hydrogen peroxide, copper, walnuts, and tea.\r\n\r\nOur products are very customizable and can be personalized with a name, monogram, logo, or just about whatever strikes your fancy.  We try our best to accommodate most requests.  Don&#39;t see what you&#39;re looking for or need help customizing one of our products?  Let us know.  We&#39;re happy to help.\r\n\r\nWe offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee and will accept returns within 14 days for a no-questions-asked-refund.  Please see our Refund Policy for more info.",

For fastest shipping, Express 1-2 day is available and will be sent as soon as your product is finished.\r\n\r\nInternational Shipping\r\n\r\nWe love shipping stuff to international customers!  All projects will ship, when completed, by USPS First-Class Mail International and can take a few weeks to a month for delivery. For faster delivery, upgrade to Priority International Flat Rate which should arrive in 6-10 business days or choose Express for the fastest delivery of 3-5 business days. All packages will be insured and have a tracking number. All duties, taxes, and import fees are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nWe Recycle\r\n\r\nThe packing and shipping materials that your item will arrive in may contain recycled boxes and packing.  We try to do our little part and reuse as much as possible.  If you intend to send our products as a gift - directly to the recipient for instance - please let us know if you would like the fancy shipping packing. \r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your questions, comments, or suggestions!",

Designed with longer thicker teeth and increased spacing between them, the No.9 allows you to tackle your long, thick, curly beard with ease. As your beard grows, so does it&#39;s grooming needs. Once your beard reaches a certain length, you&#39;ll want to transition from your No.7 or No.5 to the No.9. We recommend making the transition once you&#39;ve reach medium to long beard length. Not only will the No.9 glide through with ease, it will help de-tangle those gnarly, unruly tangles.\r\n\r\nBig Red Beard Combs are crafted with a laminated technology, which ensures that your comb is made as tough as possible. The comb is made from a total of four layers, with the two inner layers, running perpendicular to the face layers to add rigidity and strength to the teeth and body of the comb. With this process we&#39;ve drastically increased the strength to ensure your comb will be around for quite some time.\r\n\r\nPlease review the dimensions below to see the true size of the comb.\r\n\r\n-    Stay Groomed Gentlemen engraving\r\n-    Cherry outer Eastern Maple inner -creating a Maple &#39;pinstripe&#39;\r\n-    Crafted with laminated technology\r\n-    Ideal for medium to long lengths\r\n-    3-5\/8&quot;(9.5cm) long x 1-1\/2&quot;(3.9cm) wide\r\n-    Static Resistant\r\n-    Protective 100% recyclable, re-seable package\r\n\r\nSold and shipped in our distinctive \u2018Big Red\u2019 packaging, you\u2019ll be impressed and relieved to find you now have a protective case for your new Big Red Beard Comb.  We care about our combs and want to ensure they see many years of use, and that is why we\u2019ve gone through the trouble of supplying cool, yet very functional packaging.

    "description": "ALL NATURAL BEARD OIL - LARGE SIZE 50ml (2oz)\n\nFormulated with all natural ingredients, this nourishing beard oil contains Apricot Kernel Oil for beard conditioning while Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Rosemary, Peppermint and Lavender Essential Oils soothe and revitalize the beard and skin underneath.\n\nWith regular use, this highly nourishing oil will leave the beard soft and healthy. Great smelling too - thanks to the addition of a subtle blend of Rosemary, Peppermint and Lavender Essential Oils.\n\nNo artificial colours, fragrances or preservatives.\n\nContains:\nApricot Kernel Oil:\nA very mild natural oil. Cold pressed and refined from the dried kernels of the apricot fruit, Apricot Kernel Oil is known for its ability to penetrate the skin without leaving an oily feel. Rich in essential fatty acids like oleic and linoleic acid, Apricot Kernel Oil is also high in Vitamin A and C. The excellent softening and moisturizing properties of this oil are great for face and hair.\nJojoba Oil:\nThis naturally occurring oil is obtained from the jojoba plant, which is a perennial shrub native to northwestern Mexico and parts of California and Arizona. Jojoba Oil is widely used for the purposes of skin and hair care, mainly due to its striking similarity with that of human sebum (an oily matter naturally secreted by the oil glands present under the skin surface).\n\nHandmade in Cork, Ireland.\n\nIngredients: Apricot (Prunus Armeniaca) Kernel Oil, Jojoba (Simmondsia Chinensis) Seed Oil, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis) Leaf Oil, Peppermint (Mentha Piperita) Oil, Lavender (Lavendula angustifolia) Oil, *Limonene, *Linalool\n*occur naturally in essential oil\n\nContents: 50ml (approx. 2 fl. oz)\n\nFor best results, apply a a few drops 1-2 times daily, massaging throughout the beard and into the skin beneath.\n\nSHIPPING TIMES:\nI endeavour to package all products within 24-48 hours after purchase. Items are sent using the Irish Postal Service, with typical delivery times of 4-6 working days to the UK and Europe and 7-9 working days to other international destinations (US, Canada, Australia).

Formulated with a trio blend of oils to add softness and a healthy sheen to your beard, and moisturize the skin beneath.\n\nOur oil is a combination of hydrating jojoba oil, grapeseed and sunflower oil. Together these oils are coveted for their nourishing properties. Since they are all natural, they&#39;re gentle on your skin and beard, help to add volume and healthy shine. \n\nManly Man beard oil is light and conditioning, to hydrate your beard from inside the hair shaft, without weighing down your style. Our beard oils are highly concentrated, so a small amount is often all that is needed.\n\nThis extra hydrating blend is ideal for very dry beards + dry skin, as well as sensitive skin. It is an excellent moisturizer to protect from the harsh elements that can wreak havoc on your facial fuzz.\n\n\/\/ Our scented oils are appealing while applying, though they are subtle, so they mix well with other products.\n\n\n\/\/ Scents:\n\nPlease specify upon checkout, which 3 scents you would like. \nIf you do not choose scents, I will select at random.\n\n+ Winter Woods: A quintet of woodsy essences, this scent is a balanced blending of essential oils to create an aura of snow-covered woodland surroundings. Spruce and cedar lend a light timber scent, topped with a hint of spearmint, like a cold frost. A subtle undertone of patchouli adds in a masculine finish.\n\n+ Coffee Mocha: Warm, rich coffee, reminiscent of hot chocolate. Applying this oil in the morning is a great way to start your day, even if you are not an avid coffee drinker! The scent of coffee has been known to invigorate the senses, giving some a buzz without the bean!\n\n+ Spiced Apple: A deep apple spice, this scent is slightly zesty and savory, like hot apple cider. The scent of apples has been known to have a relaxing effect, making this the perfect I-was-at-the-cabin-this-weekend scent. Can&#39;t leave the office? Never fear - your beard, in all its spicy goodness, will be on vacay.\n\n+ Dark Forest: An unmistakably woodsy scent, Dark Forest is an earthy, masculine scent. Patchouli and palmarosa are the duo blend of essential oils that contribute to the forest inspired aroma. Palmarosa has an uplifting effect, like a brisk walk through the woods, while patchouli is an excellent tonic, and is a relaxing scent, making this duo of essential oils a perfectly balanced blend.\n\n+ Unscented: Why mess with a good thing, right? This oil lets your beard do its thing. Whether you can&#39;t tolerate scents or just consider yourself a simple dude who wants to get to the basic goodness of this nourishing beard oil without the distraction of scent, we&#39;ve got you covered. \n\n\n\/\/ Ingredients:\nALL beard oils contain the following ingredients:\n\nSunflower Oil, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Natural Preservative\n\n\/\/ Additional ingredients:\n\nWinter Woods: Spruce Essential Oil, Cedar Essential Oil, Patchouli Essential Oil, Spearmint Essential Oil, Rosewood Essential Oil\nCoffee Mocha: Organic Coffee Extract\nSpiced Apple: Organic Spiced Apple Extract\nDark Forest: Patchouli Essential Oil, Palmarosa Essential Oil\n\n\n\/\/ Directions:\nMassage 2-4 drops into your beard. For bigger beards, you may use more drops as needed.\nWe recommend starting with a few drops, adding more as needed. A little goes a long way!\nApplying to your dry beard will help moisturize the hair and skin, and is also beneficial for softening the hair, no matter the length.\n\n\n1 dram \/ 3.7 ml each.\nPackaged in glass bottles with dropper dispensers.\nOuter packaging may vary slightly.\n\n\nFor external use only. Avoid contact with eyes. \nStore out of reach of children.

    "description": "This comb is small. No really! It&#39;s small!\r\n\r\n2 inches wide x 1 inch tall x 1\/4 inch thick\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a mini fine toothed comb, perfect for bearded or mustached fellows.\r\n\r\nMade out of solid cherry wood. Handmade in Pennsylvania from local, sustainably harvested cherry wood. Due to the handmade and natural nature of my work, the wood grain of the comb you receive will likely vary slightly from the wood grain of the comb(s) in the pictures. \r\n\r\nThe wood is treated with food safe mineral oil, the same oil you&#39;ll find on wooden cutting boards. It is not stained or sealed with plastic. Re-oil as you wish to keep the wood soft and cared for. A coconut\/beeswax blend is recommended, however mineral oil is fine too!\r\n\r\n**** Please note: I do not take custom orders. What I have in my shop is what I have available ****",

    "description": "All orders sold in the U.S. or Canada will be shipped using Priority Mail and an email with tracking number will be sent AFTER the item has shipped*** 2 to 3 days U.S*** 6 to 10 days Canada***\r\nAll International shipping will NOT have Tracking information...\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Bearded Bear our mission is to provide our customers with the best, long-lasting beard grooming products that can soothe even the driest and itchiest of beards. We are constantly working to create innovative, all-natural ways of providing our customers with the best of the best in beard balms, waxes, and oils. Our products meet the highest quality standards and are 100% all natural.\r\n\r\nA little bit goes a long way!!!\r\n\r\nBeard Oil - For best results, use small dime size amounts  ( depending on length of Awesome beard) as needed to moisturize. Place hand over open bottle and shake upward once, rub hands together and apply to that sweet beard, use comb or brush to ensure oil is applied evenly through your manly beard. \r\n\r\nBeard Balm -For best results, Use after shower and dry your  rugged beard completely before use.\r\nUse thumb nail to scrape out dime size amount  (depending on length of  that sweet ass beard use larger amount), and put in palm of hand. Rub balm in hands until fully melted and apply to that  epic beard. \r\nUse Comb or brush to get balm  deep into your majestic beard hair.\r\n\r\nBeard Wax -For best results, use for styling and taming that magnificent beard and mustache down.\r\nUse thumb nail to scrape out dime size amount  (depending on length of kick ass beard and mustache use larger amount as needed). Place on tips of fingers and rub fingers and thumbs together until the wax is pliable. Apply to that sexy mustache and or problem areas of  that extravagant beard as needed.\r\n\r\nBeard care tips - \r\n 1. Do NOT comb or brush  when wet! Dry completely and do NOT use a blow dryer!\r\n 2. For curlier beards use BOAR HAIR bristle brush (available soon)!\r\n 3. I know it&#39;s difficult, but STOP pulling on that manly ass beard!!! its only going to make the hair weaker! and no body wants a weak beard!\r\n 4. If you haven&#39;t already bought some beard shampoo, BUY SOME!!! if you just don&#39;t feel like it, at least use shampoo WITHOUT alcohol... (look on the back of the bottle) head and shoulders is NOT what you want! and only shampoo 1 to 2 times per week.\r\n 5. Use scissors to trim when your incredible beard is combed down to how you like it. Trim a little at a time... and NEVER trim that magical beard when DRUNK!!! ( I did it once...  it was terrible!) Get drunk after you trim!\r\n 6. Last but not least... Take care of your beard... and it will take care of you!!!\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions feel free to message me..\r\n\r\n\r\nAll products are lightly scented with essential oils to give it a nice clean woodsy smell.\r\n\r\n**Burlap sacks not included with grooming kit**\r\n\r\n**International shipping provided by USPS - does NOT include Tracking number.  please allow up to 4 weeks for package to arrive.** Canada excluded",

    "title": "Merlin&#39;s Beard Wax and Oil - Beard Care Kit",
    "description": "Merlin the Wizard, teacher, adviser and council to King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, has been a central character in the classic Arthurian Legend for nearly a thousand years.\r\n\r\nMerlin&#39;s wisdom, guidance and mystique are what inspired us to create &quot;Merlin&#39;s Beard&quot; products.  While the tales of King Arthur of Camelot don&#39;t document Merlin&#39;s secrets for beard care, we can imagine the powerful wizard knew how to care for the outward symbol of his wisdom, his beard.\r\n\r\nMerlin&#39;s beard care secrets are what we&#39;ve tried to (re)create.  Since we can&#39;t use magic, we&#39;ve worked hard to create products using all natural ingredients that work like magic to grow and maintain a healthy beard. \r\n\r\nOur classic, all natural beard wax is a versatile product that provides medium hold to help tame unruly hairs without feeling heavy and uncomfortable.  The addition of shea and cocoa butters help to soften and condition your beard.\r\n\r\nThis 1 wax and 1 oil beard care kit gives you everything you need to maintain a healthy beard.  You will receive a tin of  beard wax in the scent of your choice along with a bottle of our naturally scented (no added essential oils) beard oil.   \r\n\r\nFor best results: \r\n\r\nOil:\r\nPlace desired amount in palm (5-10 drops depending on beard size), rub between palms and apply upward into freshly washed, damp beard. Comb through to coat evenly. Apply daily after shower.\r\n\r\nWax:\r\nUsing thumbnail, scrape desired amount onto back of thumb.  Gently work into palms to warm.  Apply to clean beard and comb through.  Re-apply as desired.\r\n\r\nBeard Oil Ingredients:\r\nAvocado oil\r\nSweet almond oil\r\nApricot kernel oil\r\nSunflower oil\r\nWheat Germ oil\r\nVitamin E oil\r\nJojoba oil\r\n\r\nBeard Wax Ingredients:\r\nBees wax\r\nShea butter\r\nCocoa butter\r\nSweet almond oil\r\nApricot kernel oil",
